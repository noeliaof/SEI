Package: SEI
Title: Calculating Standardised Indices Using SEI
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: 
  c(person(given = "Noelia", family = "Otero", email = "noeli1680@gmail.com", role=c('aut','cre')),
  person(given = "Sam", family = "Allen", email = "sam.allen@unibe.ch", role = c('aut')))
Description: Convert a time series of observations to a time series of standardised indices 
  that can be used to monitor variables on a common and probabilistically interpretable scale. 
  The indices can be aggregated and rescaled to different time scales, visualised
  using plot capabilities, and calculated using a range of distributions, 
  including flexible non- and semi-parametric methods.
